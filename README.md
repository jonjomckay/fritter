## Contribute
If you'd like to help make Fritter even better, here are a just a few of the ways you can help!

### Report a bug
If you've found a bug in Fritter, open a [new issue](https://github.com/jonjomckay/fritter/issues/new/choose), but please make sure to check that someone else hasn't reported it first.

### Request a feature
If you feel like something is missing from Fritter, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/jonjomckay/fritter/issues/new/choose) about it, detailing exactly what you're looking for. We'll look it over, discuss it with the community, and see if it'll work!

### Fix a bug
If you're looking for something to dip your toes into the codebase, check if there are any issues labelled good first issue. Otherwise, if you see another issue you'd like to tackle, go for it - just fork the repository, push to a branch, and create a PR detailing your changes. We'll review it and merge it in, once it meets all our checks and balances!

### Translate
Fritter uses [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/fritter/) for translations. You can help by translating the app into your preferred language(s)!

## Donate
Fritter relies on your donations for support, and to help its continued development. Below are some links to where you can contribute financially.

### Why donate?
Fritter requires constant updates to keep ahead of any API changes Twitter may make that cause it to break. There is also a large backlog of issues (144 at the time of writing), with multiple new issues created every week, from bugs to feature requests.

It'd be a dream to be able to work on Fritter more than I do at the moment, but I currently have other commitments that are required to support me financially (full-time job, and freelance work), so I'm only able to commit a small amount of free time.

Supporting Fritter financially would allow me to lower my time spent on these other commitments, and increase the time I'm able to spend on developing Fritter to help you all keep your Twitter experience as private as possible, while keeping the app secure, reliable and up-to-date 💖.

#### Some of the things funding Fritter would help accelerate are:

* Mastodon support - for being able to browse both Twitter and Mastodon content
* Persistent timeline positions - allowing you to continue where you left off in a feed
* Desktop support - allowing you to browse Twitter privately on a full-blown computer
* UX/UI improvements - such as a compact view, and tweaks to improve usability
* Nitter support - adding Nitter support back in, and helping to develop a stable API for Nitter itself
* Notifications - getting notified when selected subscriptions or groups have new tweets
* Stability - continued updates to improving the stability and reliability of the app

### Can I help non-financially?
Yes! Fritter is always looking for code, translation or any other help. Please see the Contribute section for more information.
